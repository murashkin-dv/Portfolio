<!-- Installation and Run-->

## Installation and Run

Running the project:

    1. Clone repository
    2. Create virtual environment for the repository: python -m venv venv
    3. Activate virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate (for MacOS)
    4. Install dependencies: pip install -r project/server/main/requirements.txt
    5. Run Docker service
    6. Run docker-compose "yml" files in root directory:
        6.1 development environment (with .env.dev): 
            "docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d"
        6.2 testing environment (with .env.test):
            6.2.1 run test application: "docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up -d"
            6.2.2 navigate to "project/tests" directory
            6.2.3 run tests: "pytest" (complete set), "pytest -m <mark_name> (by marks from pytest.ini)
    7. Access "http://localhost:8080/" in browser
    8. Access to user's data via construction panel using user-api values (u1, u2, u3, test)
    created as dummy in database.


***NOTE*** This project keeps the database and all tweet data stored even if
the server  shutdown or restarted by any reason.
Run these steps in command line if you want to reset the database completely:

    1. docker-compose down -v --rmi all (+ docker system prune -a)
    2. Run a desired configuration in command line (see item 3 above)
