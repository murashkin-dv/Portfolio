<!-- Installation and Run-->

## Installation and Run

Running the project:

    1. Clone repository 
    2. Navigate to root directory where docker-compose "yml" files are located
    3. Run in command line:
        3.1 development environment (with .env.dev): 
            "docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d"
        3.2 testing environment (with .env.test):
            3.2.1 run test application: "docker compose -f  docker-compose-test.yml up -d"
            3.2.2 navigate to "project/tests" directory
            3.2.3 run tests: "pytest" (complete set), "pytest -m <mark_name> (by marks from pytest.ini)
    4. Access "http://localhost:8080/" in browser

Run these steps in command line if you want to reset the database completely:

    1. docker-compose down -v --rmi all (+ docker system prune -a)
    2. Run a desired configuration in command line (see item 3 above)
